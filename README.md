# covid-analysis-project

## Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination progress. The dataset is cleaned, explored, and visualized using various techniques to highlight trends, comparisons across countries, and vaccination rollouts.

## Objectives:
- Import and clean global COVID-19 data.
- Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
- Compare metrics across countries and regions.
- Visualize trends through line charts, bar charts, and optionally a choropleth map.
- Communicate findings with narrative explanations and data insights.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib**: Visualization of trends over time.
- **Seaborn**: Enhanced statistical plots (line charts, bar charts).
- **Plotly** (optional): For creating interactive choropleth maps.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For organizing and running code interactively.
